# Trading strategies plot

Plots how different trading strategies would have performed
on historical data.

Currently implemented strategies:
- buy and hold
- buy and sell randomly

## Assumptions

The main purpose of these plots is to see if stupidly
simple strategies will (roughly) outperform professionally
managed funds. Therefore some assumptions and
simplifications are made:

 - Assumes no trading fees on transactions.
 - Assumes that you're buying and selling the entire index.
(subject to change)
